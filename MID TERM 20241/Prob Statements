P3
  Description
    There are n passengers 1, 2, …, n. The passenger i want to travel from point i to point i + n (i = 1,2,…,n). 
    There is a bus located at point 0 and has k places for transporting the passengers (it means at any time, there are at most k passengers on the bus). 
    You are given the distance matrix c in which c(i,j) is the traveling distance from point i to point j (i, j = 0,1,…, 2n).
    But the ith passenger cant stay on the bus for more than s[i] stops. (Ex: if s[i] = 2, then route "...-> i -> stop1 -> stop2 -> i+n ->..." is valid for i) 
    Compute the shortest route for the bus, serving n passengers and coming back to point 0. 
  Input
    Line 1 contains n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 11,1≤k≤10)
    Line i+1 (i=1,2,…,2n+1) contains the (i−1)th line of the matrix c (rows and columns are indexed from 0,1,2,..,2n).
    Line 2n+3 contains the array s[i]
  Output
    Unique line contains the length of the shortest route.


P4
  Description
    You are given a maze[n][n] (max = 10000) contains of 0s and 1s, where 1s are obsticles.
    Starting from (1,1), you can only go down or right at each steps.
    Calculate the numbers of ways to get to point (a,b) (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n).
  Input 
    Line 1 contains n and (a,b)
    Line 2 to n + 1 contains the maze (0s and 1s)
  Output
    Number of ways to get to point (a,b) from (1,1)
